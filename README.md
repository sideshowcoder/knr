# KNR Excercises

Setup for CMake and Clang adapted
from [cmake-boilerplate](https://github.com/arunoda/cmake-boilerplate)

## Ubuntu

install cmake, llvm and clang

## Build

```
$ cmake . && make
```

## Test

Is done via minunit

```
$ cmake . && make && make check
```

use `make check` for verbose output `make test` to get a simple fail or success.
